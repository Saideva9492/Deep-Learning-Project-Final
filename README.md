# Comparative Study for Diagnosing Skin Cancer Using Deep Learning Models
Skin cancer diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. Traditional methods rely heavily on visual examinations by dermatologists, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This project investigates how deep learning models can enhance diagnostic accuracy and speed.

### Overview:
This project explores the application of deep learning models for the diagnosis of skin cancer, focusing on the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the VGG16 model. The study leverages a substantial dataset from Kaggle containing images of benign and malignant skin lesions, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of skin cancer classification.

### Project Description:
Skin cancer diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. Traditional methods rely heavily on visual examinations by dermatologists, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This project investigates how deep learning models can enhance diagnostic accuracy and speed.

## Methodology
### Dataset Preparation:

The dataset includes high-resolution images of benign and malignant skin lesions.
Images are preprocessed using OpenCV to ensure uniformity in size and color channels, and resized to 224x224 pixels for consistency.
### Model Design:

### Custom CNN Model :
A bespoke Convolutional Neural Network is designed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.
### VGG16 Model:
The pre-trained VGG16 model is employed using transfer learning, with its top layers replaced to suit the binary classification task of identifying benign vs. malignant lesions.

### Training and Testing:

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Both models are trained using Keras with TensorFlow backend, optimizing parameters using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function.
Results
### Custom CNN Model:

Achieved an accuracy of 82.12%, with high precision and recall values for both benign and malignant classifications.
The model showed fluctuations in training and validation accuracy, indicating potential overfitting.
### VGG16 Model:

Achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 83.33%.
Demonstrated robustness in identifying benign cases but required improvements in detecting malignant cases.
### Conclusion:
The comparative study demonstrates that both the custom CNN and the VGG16 model are effective in diagnosing skin cancer, with the VGG16 model showing a slight edge in accuracy. The study highlights the potential of deep learning models to revolutionize dermatological diagnostics, offering faster and more accurate alternatives to traditional methods. Future work will focus on enhancing model generalizability and stability through advanced regularization and data augmentation techniques.
